    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my blog! I am a software developer interested in computer science related technologies and figuring out how system works. I strongly believe in critical thinking and logic when programming -  having a clear and superb logical mind is more critical than simply coding and make things work. I'd like to make this blog as my source of records to mark down important notes in daily development. </p>
    <p> Please feel free to reach me at <a href="mailto:tange116@gmail.com">tange116@gmail.com</a>. Thank you. </p>
